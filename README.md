# facenetValidationOnRegDataset
I just made a change on the source code FaceNetVerCode. In my file, we can verify whether a person is in the register dataset or not. The prerequisite is that you should prepare for your own register dataset, which should be aligned in advance. And for how to align the images, please see https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet/wiki/Classifier-training-of-inception-resnet-v1.
